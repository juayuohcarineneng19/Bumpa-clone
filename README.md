# Bumpa Homepage Clone

This project involved cloning the homepage of [Bumpa](https://bumpa.com/), an all-in-one business management platform for African SMEs, using React. 

## Overview

- Cloned the visual design and key elements of Bumpa's homepage using React components
- Created responsive layout that adapts across desktop and mobile
- Implemented core functionality like navigation, sliders, modals etc
- Utilized React Hooks for state management 
- Leveraged React Context API for global state
- Used React Router for navigation between sections
- Styled components using  pure CSS

## Goals

The goal was to gain hands-on experience building a frontend site in React by recreating a professional homepage design. This helped reinforce:

- Creating reusable React components
- Passing props and managing state effectively
- Working with React hooks and Context API
- Responsive web design
- Stying components with pure css

## Running the Project

To run this React project locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch the homepage on http://localhost:3000

## Room for Improvement

Some ways this project could be expanded on:

- Integrating with Bumpa's actual API or creating a mock backend
- Adding more pages and routes 
- Implementing more interactive elements
- Improving accessibility
- Adding tests

## Key Learnings

Recreating Bumpa's homepage provided great experience working with core React concepts. I'm now more comfortable with:

- Breaking designs down into reusable component hierarchies
- Fetching and displaying dynamic data 
- Responsive web development workflows
- CSS 
- Working with React Router
